# itinerare | Ad/Mercury

Hello! I'm Ad or Mercury. I'm a freelance web developer particularly keen on projects that help enable creative endeavors.

Most of my personal projects are hosted at https://code.itinerare.net and mirrored here for ease of participation.
Check my pinned repositories for some projects I'm particularly involved in otherwise as well as [my site](https://itinerare.net) for more of my work!
